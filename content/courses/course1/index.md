## Introduction

The objective of this course is to analyze the aggregate or "macro" behavior of the US economy. The first part of the course will examine the economic theory of the long run. We will study the factors that determine income, savings, and consumption in the long-run with a special focus on theories of economic growth. The second part of the course will consider short-run business-cycle issues, like how unemployment and inflation change during periods of unusually fast economic growth or periods of unusually slow or even negative growth. We will also examine current issues in the conduct of monetary and fiscal policy. The goals of the course aim to give you the tools needed to analyze the aggregate behavior of the US economy and understand it in a coherent framework, understand monetary and fiscal policy responses to short- and long-run economic problems, and familiarize you with macro data and their interpretations in the context of the models.
